Ilya & Emilia Kabakov, *In the Closet* (1997). The installation is arranged in the foyer of some establishment in a neutral space or in a walkway or wide corridor in a museum – precisely in a place where there is no ‘artistic’ object whatsoever or where a work of art is totally unexpected. The viewer, walking through such a place, sees an old closet built into the wall, one door of which is slightly ajar. The built-in closet should attract attention precisely because of its old, worn appearance as compared to the ‘modern’ white space of the wall. When the viewer opens the closet, to his great surprise he sees a table on which the ‘inhabitant’ eats, a corner for dishes, and a light-bulb for reading burns above a narrow bed. Everything in this residence is very crowded, intended for a long and comfortable life. The whole idea of the installation becomes immediately obvious to the outside viewer: the person who has settled into the closet has hidden precisely from such curious people as the viewer.

Tehching Hsieh, *Outdoor Piece* (1981). "In 1981, Taiwanese endurance artist Tehching Hsieh ventured out into the streets of New York City and proceeded to live outdoors for a full year. Hsieh essentially takes on the identity of a homeless individual—although “houseless” would be a more apt description of his type of purposeful displacement—calling into question tensions between public and private spaces and their impact on our everyday lives, as well as the way in which public spaces are navigated on a daily basis."
